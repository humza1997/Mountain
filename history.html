        <h2 class="head">History</h2>
        <p class="head">The WMRA was founded in 1984 as the International Committee for Mountain Running and the decision to change the name to the World Mountain Running Association was taken in 1998. In 1985, the organisation staged the first annual World Mountain Running Trophy. In 2002, World Athletics (then the IAAF) officially recognised the World Trophy as an international competition and in 2009 the name was changed to the World Mountain Running Championships.

            The WMRA also stages the annual World Long Distance Mountain Running Challenge and a World Cup series of races.</p>
